Logic framework built for fun

Nothing here. I'll be building this thing in my free time, diving into [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory), [relational algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra), [type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory), [model theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory), [formal semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_(natural_language)), [abstract interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation), [symbolic execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution) and [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus), hoping to find something interesting that connects all the dots together.

The main goal is ~~not to learn Datalog or Prolog~~ being able to build any new knowledge+logic framework using Python code.
I'd do that for many purposes:
- Examining the implications of my interpretations of facts
- Having a funnel to gather and validate my knowledge in different areas
- Writing [codegens that don't suck](https://github.com/bswck/generate-errno-stub) to test new software
- Writing specifications

When humans learn, they are essentially building a graph. That graph often needs to express relations between sets, unknown concepts or known facts.

What frustrates me deeply is the ambiguity that tampers that graph. The ambiguity or [incompleteness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems#Formal_systems:_completeness,_consistency,_and_effective_axiomatization) in academic books have real consequences. At least to me, they make it very difficult to solve tests.

I often have tons of questions about new knowledge, but they come from very different reasons that I often find only subconscious. I'd like to have any formal-like system that can verify them, simplify some, and point me to what the ambiguities are in the new things that I learn about the world.
