Logic framework built for fun

Nothing here. I'll be building this thing in my free time, diving into [model theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory), [formal semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_(natural_language)), [abstract interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation), [symbolic execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution) and [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus), hoping to find something interesting that connects all the dots together.

The main goal is ~~not to learn Datalog or Prolog~~ being able to build any new knowledge+logic framework using Python code.
I'd do that for many purposes:
- Examining the implications of my interpretations of facts
- Writing [codegens that don't suck](https://github.com/bswck/generate-errno-stub) to test new software
- Writing specifications
